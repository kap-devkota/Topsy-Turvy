* Topsy-Turvy 
** Summary
Topsy-Turvy is a novel method that synthesizes protein sequence information and 
inherent network structures transferrable across species to construct and/or enrich the PPI 
network for the target species.  


For more information about the model architectures (and downloading the pretained models
and datasets), go to [[]].

** Files and Folders

All the relevant test and evaluation codes are found inside the topsy_turvy folder. 
The major files for training/evaluation are:

1. embedding.py  
2. train.py
3. evaluate.py



`embedding.py` is used to produce the PLM embeddings from the input sequence file in 
fasta format. It can be run using

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
      python embedding.py --seqs=<SEQ-FASTA-FILE> --o=<OUTPUT-DEST-FILE> --d=<GPU-DEVICE-ID>
#+END_SRC


`train.py` is used to train the model, given the sequence and network information for a source 
network. It can be run using

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#+END_SRC
