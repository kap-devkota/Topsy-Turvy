# Topsy-Turvy


<a id="orgdcf3d8d"></a>

## Summary

Topsy-Turvy is a novel method that synthesizes protein sequence information and 
inherent network structures transferrable across species to construct and/or enrich the PPI 
network for the target species.  

For more information about the model architectures (and downloading the pretained models
and datasets), go to [[]].

## Files and Folders

All the relevant test and evaluation codes are found inside the topsy<sub>turvy</sub> folder. 
The major files for training/evaluation are:

1.  embedding.py
2.  train.py
3.  evaluate.py

\`embedding.py\` is used to produce the PLM embeddings from the input sequence file in 
fasta format. It can be run using

    python embedding.py --seqs=<SEQ-FASTA-FILE> --o=<OUTPUT-DEST-FILE> --d=<GPU-DEVICE-ID>

\`train.py\` is used to train the model, given the sequence and network information for a source 
network. It can be run using
